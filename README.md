# bookish-waffle
Code for Book-Finder Project
So along with changing the elements and colors of the homescreen, there was the inclusion of many new files.
There are two background images that are being used on the home screen and the new app logo is posted within this commit.
The app has also been built for android and ios, so there are app icons for both and a default splash screen for both.
There has been an addition of numerous files.
